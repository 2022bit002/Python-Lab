1. Type Error :  Unhasable 
	In Python, a dictionary key must be hashable, meaning it needs to be immutable and have a fixed hash value for its lifetime. Lists are mutable, meaning they can change, so they cannot be used as dictionary keys. Here are some common scenarios where you might encounter a "TypeError: unhashable type" error.
	
	
2. * and ** is use to unpack the list and the dictionary as per the convinence of the user

3. 	locals and globals are the local and global scope of the variable whereas the global key word change the scope of the variable from the local to the global
	
4.	while any object that implements the __iter__() method can be considered iterable, not all iterable objects are iterators. Iterators must implement both the __iter__() and __next__() methods, allowing them to maintain state and provide elements one at a time until they are exhausted. This distinction is crucial for understanding how Python's iteration protocol works.
